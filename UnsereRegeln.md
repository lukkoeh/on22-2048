# Selected Branching Model
For simplicity as well as effectivity reasons we decided on the Github-Flow Branching model. This includes locking the main branch which represents the production-ready code. Changes to main will be merged via pull requests.

# Other rules
- Changes shall be pulled via git pull regularly
- Commits are not supposed to be as big as possible, much rather we should use all the capabilites of git.
- Commit messages are composed according to a schematic, short description, long description, explain effects.
- Everyone has to commit at least once.
